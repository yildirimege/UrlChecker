# UrlChecker
Python script that sends requests to url's  in text file and prints their Response, then prints all working url's 


HOW TO USE:

After subdomain search for any website, (lets say with sublist3r). Just copy paste the sublist3r output to text file and change hardcoded links.txt string to you text file's name and execute. Program will print HTTP respons for existing url's and list them after checking is finished.
